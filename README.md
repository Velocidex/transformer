# Transformer is a tool to transform a repository

Transformer will transform a repository from one form to another form
but applying transformations on it.

This is useful when there are two versions of the same repository,
perhaps with different feature sets. Transformer will copy all files
from one repository, applying transformations on some of these files,
and merging other files into the new repository.
